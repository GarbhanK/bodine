## Initial Commit

For this project I want to create a simple message broker using Python. I have the most experience writing python code professionally but nothing to show in my portfolio, so hopefully this is a good way to fill that gap. The name `Bodine` comes from the character Pig Bodine in Thomas Pynchon's V (I wanted to do something kafka-like).

The setup I have to get this off the ground is more of a playground for me to refresh my knowledge on TCP and socket programming. I have a 
basic 'broker' service in the middle that will handle incoming connections and distribute messages to connected clients. I've scaffolded out what I want the API to look like under `examples/` and am building up the `Producer` and `Consumer` classes around it.

I'm choosing to go with length-prefixed JSON for the messaging protocol for two reasons. Firstly, it's a good balance between something heavier such as newline-delimited JSON, and something faster (but slower to develop and harder to debug) like gRPC protobufs.

## Story so far
- python project setup
- broken up into `broker`, `client` and `examples` directories
- broker is accepting TCP socket connections and forwarding messages onto subscribers

## Long-term goals

- custom write-ahead-log (call it PIG)
- multiple delivery options (at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once)
- Upgrade to being a multi-node distributed broker
- kubernetes-ready
